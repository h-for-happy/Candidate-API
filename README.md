# Candidate-API
## Node.js API using express and MYSQL
 
I have designed database tables In which there are two entities “candidate” and “test_score”. Candidate has properties name, email address
Every candidate has to give 3 tests like “first_round”, “second_round”, “third_round” and scoring for every test is done out of 10. 

## What Does API perform:-
1. Insert a candidate into the database.
2. Assign score for a candidate based on the test.
3. Get the highest scoring candidate and average scores per round for all candidates.
